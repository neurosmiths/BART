function c = redblue(m)
%REDBLUE    Shades of red and blue color map
%   REDBLUE(M), is an M-by-3 matrix that defines a colormap.
%   The colors begin with bright blue rangin to red.
%	REDBLUE, by itself, is the same length as the current figure's
%   colormap. If no figure exists, MATLAB creates one.
%
%   For example, to reset the colormap of the current figure:
%
%             colormap(redblue)
%
%   See also HSV, GRAY, HOT, BONE, COPPER, PINK, FLAG, 
%   COLORMAP, RGBPLOT.
